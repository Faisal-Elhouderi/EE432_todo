# EE432 Data Structures Extra Assignment: Python To-Do List

A simple desktop (or console-based) application in Python that allows users to manage a to-do list. This project showcases object-oriented programming principles, data structures, and user-friendly features like adding, deleting, searching, and displaying tasks.

## Overview

This application was created as part of the **EE432 Data Structures Extra Assignment**. The main goal is to implement a **to-do list** manager in Python that demonstrates:

- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) concepts  
- **Data Structure** manipulation (insertion, deletion, search)  
- **Data Persistence** (saving tasks between sessions)  

By completing this project, students learn how to design a maintainable application while practicing best coding practices.

## Features

1. **Add New Tasks**  
   - Each task includes a **description** (string), **priority** (e.g., High, Medium, Low), and a **completion status** (True/False).

2. **Delete Tasks**  
   - Users can remove tasks from the list based on task ID or description.

3. **Search Tasks**  
   - Quickly find tasks by description or priority. Emphasis on efficient searching.

4. **Display Tasks**  
   - Lists all tasks in a user-friendly format, with optional sorting (e.g., by priority or completion status).

5. **Mark Completion**  
   - Update a taskâ€™s status to mark it as complete or incomplete.

6. **(Optional) Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
   - For advanced users, a GUI can be built with libraries such as **Tkinter**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **OOP** (classes for Task, TaskManager, etc.)  
- **(Optional) GUI Framework** (Tkinter)

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed  
- Git (if you are cloning the repository)  
- (Optional) Additional libraries for GUI or database (e.g., Tkinter)
